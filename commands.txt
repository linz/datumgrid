datumgrd

Program to fit a deformation grid to a set of point displacements. 
The grid extends to a specified distance from the points.  The fitting
balances two factors, 1) matching the point displacements, and 2)
minimizing the distortion in each grid cell (ie shear and non-linear 
distortion).

Data file:
    
    Space separated file containing:
    
    	id east north deast dnorth class [error]
    
    east and north coordinates are in the same units as the final 
    grid.  deast, dnorth in metres.  Command file defines a scale
    factor from east/north coordinates to metres.  The error can 
    be supplied, otherwise it will be based on a default error or
    class based error defined in the command file.
    
    May contain comments prefixed with ! or #
    
Command file:
    
    Commands one per line.  Comments prefixed with ! or #.
    Grid spacing is defined in east/north units.
    required_point_proximity defines the minimum extent around 
    points that the grid will extend in metres.
    zero_outside_proximity will force the grid to fit a zero
    deformation outside the proximity from data points, otherwise
    it is unconstrained at the boundaries.
    distortion_error and default_point_error define the errors
    (weighting) applied to the control points and grid cell 
    distortion.  
    Point errors can also be defined on a per class basis, or
    for individual points in the command file.  If specified
    for specific points they over-ride errors specified in 
    otherwise they do not.
    Points and classes of points may also be rejected from the 
    calculation.
